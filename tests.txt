These are things that I need to test:

- can mulitple input files be accepted?
- can input files with more than necessary columns be accepted and properly processed?
- does the script write to the correct output directory?


Questions I have:

- do I care about the clustering method? aka should I save its name?



Notes from meeting with Artem

spend at least of half oteh presentation setting the stage. pick either mcmicro or sms to present.

assess how well clustering worked by looking at 
- a heatmap or clustergram. this is used only on max several hundred features/cells
- t- SNE. its difficult to know how valid resutls are because perplexity parameter changes things so much
- UMAP is best. load in log transformed expression data and then color with the cluster assignments from the different methods and see if they match the UMAP clusters well
